# Welcome!
# In this project, we will be building a weather app which collects and displays the weather for a certain location.
# We will guide you through the code step by step, if there are any questions then feel free to ask the mentors.
#
# Important here is that we will step away from the ease of the Jupyter Notebooks that we used in the 'Intro to Python'
# This is done because with the '.py' files, which are Python files, we can call them from anywere and it will execute the code and functions specified within.
# This makes it easier to run bigger applications and more nested structure of code.
# It may seem daunting to use the terminal to run Python code but we are here to guide you through the process!
#
# See this url for more info on terminal versus notebook execution of Python code.
